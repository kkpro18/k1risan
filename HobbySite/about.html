    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>So this hobby, originally begun when i discovered a youtube video about how a person created their own app, where i watched each part of the series in sequence. Though i did not get a solid understanding, it had increased my interest in this field
        further, where i had decided that, for me to build my very own software, programs and applications i would need to first learn the syntax of a programming language. This is where i discovered apps and websites such as sololearn, codecademy, mimo
        and so on. Through this i was able to learn many languages such as c++, Python, HTML, CSS. Where HTML and CSS is being used to form this entire website.</p>
